### About Jing-Ping
I am a glial biologist with a deep interest in how cellular and molecular interactions shape brain health and disease. My research uses the preclinical models to uncover the cellular and spatial dynamics of white matter pathology, with the long-term goal of advancing diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. I value collaboration, curiosity, and rigor as the foundation for impactful science.

> I see no failed experiments—only designs that can be improved. Every unexpected result becomes a steppingstone to new discoveries


### Philosophy & Lab Culture
The lab is built around openness, mutual respect, and intellectual generosity. We approach problems by integrating diverse perspectives—neurobiology, imaging, single-cell/spatial omics—and by questioning assumptions. Every member is encouraged to take ownership of their ideas, while also contributing to the collective success of the group. Mistakes are treated as opportunities to learn and grow as scientists. People are as important as conducting high-quality research.

### Roles & Responsibility
- **PI (Jing-Ping):** Provide scientific vision, mentorship, and resources; ensure a supportive and productive environment.
- **Lab members:** Drive their own projects with initiative, while collaborating and sharing expertise; maintain integrity, rigor, and transparency in all work.
- **Collective responsibility:** Foster a culture of respect, inclusivity, and accountability, where lab operations and community well-being are shared priorities.

### What you can expect
You can expect a mentor who is deeply invested in your development, both scientifically and professionally. You can expect constructive feedback, encouragement to pursue your ideas, and opportunities to learn new skills. You will be supported in presenting your work, building collaborations, and preparing for your next career step. Above all, you can expect a lab culture that values creativity, perseverance, and kindness.

Practically, you will learn the lab workflow—both technically and philosophically—which I view as the life cycle of how a researcher is made and begins to make an **IMPACT**:

- **Input** – gather information to understand the current landscape
- **Map** – design experimental strategies and workflows
- **Perform** – execute experiments or interventions systematically
- **Articulate** – analyze and communicate results with clarity
- **Connect** – situate your findings within the wider scientific community
- **Transform** – generate new knowledge and refine models of understanding
