      <h2>PI: Jing-Ping Lin, PhD</h2>
      <h3>Assistant professor, University of Arizona</h3>
     <p> Her career path began with asking about how embryonic cells live, evolved into asking about how cancer cells die, and now brings her to ask about how injured neuroglial cells repair. She is drawn to solving these puzzles, which led her to use multimodal approaches to study the cellular functions in disease and health across species. </p>

      <h2>Honorary Member #2: Ginger Smith</h2>
      <h3>Now: Postbaccalaureate Trainee, NINDS, NIH</h3>
    <p> Ginger earned her undergraduate degree in Neuroscience from the University of Virginia in 2023 and is currently a post-baccalaureate research fellow in Dr. Daniel Reich’s lab at NIH. Working closely with Dr. Lin for the past two years, her project aims to characterize the diverse functions of glial cells during myelin deterioration and repair in a marmoset model of multiple sclerosis. Ginger is an avid lover of all things glia, and is currently applying to Neuroscience PhD programs to continue investigating glial cells in neurodevelopment and neurological diseases.</p> 
    <p> Outside of the lab, she loves to take long walks, go to concerts with friends, and research fashion trends!</p>

      <h2>Next Member: YOU !!</h2>
      <h3>Join Our Lab</h3>
       
    <p>We are excited to welcome new members to our team! Our lab studies how brain cells and their interactions shape health and disease, with a focus on understanding and treating neurological disorders. We use a combination of imaging, transcriptomics, and model systems to explore these questions, and we value curiosity, creativity, and collaboration.</p>

      
   <p>If you are passionate about science, enjoy working in a supportive and interdisciplinary environment, and want to contribute to discoveries that may transform how we understand and treat brain disorders, we’d love to hear from you.</p>

    <p>We welcome inquiries from prospective graduate students, postdocs, and research staff. </p>
