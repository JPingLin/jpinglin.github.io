This is something to test , can we do this is thonga a big chunk of code
We study how glial cells and their networks keep the brain healthy—and what happens when these systems break down in development, aging, and inflammation. Right now, we are investigating how white matter dynamics shape glial function in preclinical models of multiple sclerosis. Combining neuroimaging, digital histopathology, and spatial omics, and to perform cross-species comparisons, we aim to uncover the mechanisms that drive myelin damage and repair, paving the way for better diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders.

      <h2>PI: Jing-Ping Lin, PhD</h2>
      <h3>Assistant professor, University of Arizona Department of Physiology</h3>
     <p> Her career path began with asking about how embryonic cells live, evolved into asking about how cancer cells die, and now brings her to ask about how injured neuroglial cells repair. She is drawn to solving these puzzles, which led her to use multimodle approaches to study the cellular functions in disease and health across species. </p>
